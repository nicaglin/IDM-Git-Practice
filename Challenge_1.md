We're going to practice the [_forking workflow_](https://github.com/philsinatra/IDM-T380/blob/master/instructor_materials/03-git.md#forking). Send your change to me (Phil) as a pull request on GitHub. I will act as the _integration manager_ for this challenge. If all members of all teams complete this challenge before class next week, you will all receive an extra credit point towards your final project.
